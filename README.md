This project proposes a photovoltaic (PV) model for the design of PV systems with a simple MPPT to achieve high efficiency, faster response and low cost. First, a PV panel model is developed using SPICE code in Proteus tool. The verification and the validation are performed via an experimental test bench based on Arduino board. Afterwards, Both methods (Incremental conductance and Perturb & observe) are implemented in the low-cost Arduino Uno board using the simulated PV panel model. To validate our system, a hardware testbench is implemented using the low-cost ATMega328 microcontroller in the Arduino Uno board. Substantial cost reduction has been attained proving the financial competitiveness of the proposed controller.
